1,Tomato,Tomatoes are Americaâ€™s favorite garden vegetable. (Yes we technically eat the fruit of the tomato plant but it's used as a vegetable in eating and cooking and thus usually categorized in vegetables.) This vine plant is fairly easy to grow and will produce a bumper crop with proper care. Its uses are versatile however tomatoes are susceptible to a range of pests and diseases.,1,1,45,12-24,12-24,Leave your tomatoes on the vine as long as possible. The perfect tomato for picking will be firm and very red in color regardless of size with perhaps some yellow remaining around the stem. A ripe tomato will be only slightly soft. Pick at the base of the stem.
4,Carrots,Carrots are a popular root vegetable that are easy to grow in sandy soil. They are resistant to most pests and diseases and are a good late season crop that can tolerate frost. Not all carrots are orange; varieties vary in color from purple to white.,2,1,90,3-4,3-4,You may harvest whenever desired maturity is reached. You may leave mature carrots in the soil for storage if the ground will not freeze.
6,Beans,Pole and bush beans (more commonly called green beans) are a tender vegetable and a great addition to any garden great eaten fresh off the plant or incorporated into a recipe. Bush beans require less maintenance so they are easier to grow.,4,1,30,2-4,2-4,Beans are picked at an immature stage when the seeds inside have not yet fully developed. Look for firm sizable pods and snap or cut off the plant. Do not tear the plant.
8,Broccoli,Broccoli is a cool-season crop that like spinach can be grown in the spring or fall. In fact you may be able to get a continual harvest throughout both seasons if you time planting correctly. A member of the cabbage family broccoli is rich in vitamins.,1,1,120,12-24,12-24,In terms of timing: Harvest broccoli when the buds of the head are firm and tight before the heads flower. If you see yellow petals harvest immediately. For best taste harvest in the morning before the soil heats up. Cut the stalk of the main head at a slant about 5 to 8 inches below the head. Most varieties have side-shoots that will continue to develop after the main head is harvested. You can harvest from one plant for many weeks.
9,Brussels Sprouts,Brussels Sprouts are a member of the cabbage family and an excellent source of protein and vitamins. They have a long growing season and are generally more successful when grown for a fall harvest as they only increase in flavor after a light frost or two.,3,1,45,12-24,12-24,Harvest sprouts from the bottom of the stalk when they reach about 1 inch in diameter. Do not wash the sprouts before storing them only right before use.
10,Cabbage,Cabbage is a hardy leafy vegetable full of vitamins. It can be difficult to grow; it only likes cool temperatures and it can be a magnet for some type of pests. By planning your growing season and providing diligent care you may have two successful crops in one year both spring and fall. Many varieties are available to suit both your growing conditions and taste preferences.,2,4,60,12-24,12-24,Harvest when heads reach desired size and are firm. This will take around 70 days for most green cabbage varieties. Most early varieties will produce 1- to 3-pound heads. Cut each cabbage head at its base with a sharp knife. After harvesting bring inside or put in shade immediately. To get two crops from early cabbage plants cut the cabbage head out of the plant leaving the outer leaves and root in the garden. The plant will send up new heads pinch them off until only four or so smaller heads remain. When these grow to tennis-ball size they'll be perfect for salad.
11,Cauliflower,Cauliflower is a cool-season crop and a descendant of the common cabbage. It is more difficult to than its relatives because it does not tolerate the heat or cold as well. For this reason cauliflower is usually grown commercially. If you plan to attempt growing cauliflower in the home garden it requires consistently cool temperatures with temperatures in the 60s. Otherwise it prematurely â€œbuttonâ€â€”form small button-size headsâ€”rather than forming one nice white head.,4,1,70,24-30,24-30,When the heads are compact white and firm then it is time to harvest them. Ideally the heads will grow 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Cut the heads off the plant with a large knife. Be sure to leave some of the leaves around the head to keep it protected. If the heads are too small but have started to open up they will not improve and should be harvested. If the cauliflower has a coarse appearance it is too mature and should be tossed.
13,Chives,Chives are a perennial member of the onion family that sport beautiful purple flowers. Chives are cool-season cold-tolerant perennials that are planted in early spring. Be mindful when planting this herb as it will take over your garden if the flowers are left to ripen (the flowers scatter the seeds). However this plant is easy to dig up and move if it overwhelms your garden.,1,1,45,4-6,4-6,Harvest chives 30 days after you transplant or 60 days after seeding. Cut the leaves down to the base when harvesting (within 1 to 2 inches of the soil). Harvest 3 to 4 times during the first year. In subsequent years cut plants back monthly. The chive plant will flower in May or June. (The flowers are edible.)
14,Collard Greens,Collard Greens are a hardy cool-season green that are part of the cabbage family. They grow best in the spring and fall and can tolerate all fall frosts.,3,1,90,8-12,8-12,Collards are ready to harvest when the leaves are about the size of your hand. Pick about one fistful of leaves per harvest. Avoid picking the terminal bud (found at the top center of the plant) because this will help to keep the plant productive. The small tender leaves can be eaten uncooked and used in salads.
15,Cucumbers,Cucumbers are a warm-season vegetable planted outside in the ground no earlier than 2 weeks after last spring frost date. Most varieties will grow in any amount of space thanks to the plant's ability to climb. The most common varieties of slicing cucumbers have sprawling vines with large green leaves and curling tendrils. The growth of these plants is fast and the crop yield is abundant if you care for them properly.,2,1,30,4,4,Harvest regular slicing cucumbers when they about 6 to 8 inches long (slicing varieties). Harvest dills at 4 to 6 inches long and pickles at 2 inches long for pickles. Harvest by cutting or pinching at the base of the fruit. Cucumbers are best picked before they seeds become hard and are eaten when immature. Do not let them get yellow. A cucumber is of highest quality when it is uniformly green firm and crisp. At peak harvesting time you should be picking cucumbers every couple of days. Keep them picked. If you donâ€™t as plants mature they will stop producing.
16,Sweet Corn,Sweet corn is an annual with yellow white and bi-colored ears. A long frost-free growing season is necessary after planting. Sweet corn is wind-pollinated so it should be planted in blocks rather than in single rows. Early mid and late-season varieties extend the harvest. If you miss the optimal harvest time corn will go downhill fast as sugars convert to starch.,4,1,120,12,12,Harvest when tassels begin to turn brown and cobs start to swell. Kernels should be full and milky. Pull ears downward and twist to take off stalk.
17,Eggplant,Eggplants are short-lived perennial vegetables but are usually cultivated as annuals. Also known as aubergines eggplants differ mainly in size shape and color of the fruits. Eggplants are tropical and subtropical requiring relatively high temperatures. Related crop include tomatoes potatoes and peppers.,1,1,45,24-30,24-30,Harvest 16 to 24 weeks after sowing when the skin of the fruit is shiny and unwrinkled. Cut the fruit close to the stem but leaving about an inch of it attached.
18,Onion,Onions are a cold-season crop easy to grow because of their hardiness. We recommend using onion sets which can be planted without worry of frost damage and have a higher success rate than direct seed or transplants. Onions grow well on raised beds or raised rows at least 4 inches high.,3,1,60,12-18,12-18,When tops are brown pull the onions. Be sure to harvest in late summer before cool weather. Mature onions may spoil in fall weather.
19,Garlic,Garlic is easy to grow and produces numerous bulbs after a long growing season. It is frost tolerant. Beyond its intense flavor and culinary uses â€œthe stinking roseâ€ is good in the garden as an insect repellent and has been used for centuries as a home remedy.,2,4,70,4-5,4-5,Harvest time depends on when you plant but the clue is to look for yellow tops. Harvest when the tops begin to yellow and fall over before they are completely dry. To harvest carefully lift the bulbs with a spade or garden fork. Pull the plants carefully brush off the soil and let them cure in an airy shady spot for two weeks. We hang them upside down on a string in bunches of 4 to 6. Make sure all sides get good air circulation.
20,Kale,Kale is a hardy cool-season green that is part of the cabbage family. It grows best in the spring and fall and can tolerate all fall frosts. Kale can be used in salads or as a garnish and is rich in minerals and vitamins A and C.,4,1,45,8-12,8-12,Kale is ready to harvest when the leaves are about the size of your hand. Pick about one fistful of leaves per harvest. Avoid picking the terminal bud (found at the top center of the plant) because this will help to keep the plant productive. The small tender leaves can be eaten uncooked and used in salads.
21,Cantaloupe,What we commonly refer to as â€˜cantaloupeâ€™ is actually not true cantaloupe rather a type of muskmelon. (True cantaloupe has a rough warty rind and is not widely grown or commercially available in the US.) Muskmelons are a heat-loving fruit with a long growing season. Their cultural and growing requirements are very similar to other melons. They have a net-like tan rind and sweet orange flesh. The names muskmelon and cantaloupe are used interchangeably. We will use the name cantaloupe for this page to avoid confusion.,1,1,90,18,18,When rinds begin to change from green to tan or yellow the melon is probably ripe but be careful not to pick too early. Look for a crack in the stem where it attaches to the fruit. This is a sign of ripeness as well. The fruit should be easy to separate from the vine but if they fall off by themselves they are usually overripe. Harvest melon when vines are dry and be careful not to damage them.
24,Bell Peppers,Peppers are a tender warm-season crop. They resist most pests and offer something for everyone: spicy sweet or hot and a variety of colors shapes and sizes. For this page we will focus on sweet bell peppers.,3,1,30,18-24,18-24,Harvest as soon as peppers reach desired size and color(green peppers are just a less mature stage of red yellow or purple bell peppers). The longer bell peppers stay on the plant the more sweet they become and the greater their Vitamin C content. Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut peppers clean off the plant for the least damage.
25,Potatoes,This half hardy vegetable is a culinary staple and yet is overlooked by many backyard gardeners. The taste and texture of home-grown potatoes are far superior to store bought especially the early varieties. They need a cool climate and also need to be watched to prevent sunburn. Potatoes can be grown as a winter crop in warmer climate zones.,2,1,120,12,12,Dig potatoes on a dry day. Dig up gently being careful not to puncture the tubers. The soil should not be compact so digging should be easy. New potatoes will be ready for harvest after 10 weeks usually in early July. You should harvest all of your potatoes once the vines die (usually by late August) or the potatoes may rot.
26,Pumpkins,Whether you use them for carving or cooking pumpkins do not disappoint. Note that pumpkins do require a lot of food and a long growing season (generally from 75 to 100 frost-free days) so you need to plant them by late May in northern locations to early July in extremely southern states. Do not plant this tender vegetable until all danger of frost has passed and the soil is warmed as the seedlings will be injured or rot. (See the Almanac.com/Gardening page for frost dates.) That said pumpkins are easy to maintain if you have the space.,4,1,45,48-96,48-96,Your best bet is to harvest pumpkins when they are mature. They will keep best this way. Do not pick pumpkins off the vine because they have reached your desired size. If you want small pumpkins buy a small variety. A pumpkin is ripening when its skin turns a deep solid color (orange for most varieties). When you thumb the pumpkin the rind will feel hard and it will sound hollow. Press your nail into the pumpkinâ€™s skin; if it resists puncture it is ripe. To harvest the pumpkin cut the fruit off the vine carefully with a sharp knife or pruners; do not tear. Be sure not to cut too close to the pumpkin; a liberal amount of stem (3 to 4 inches) will increase the pumpkinâ€™s keeping time.
27,Radish,Radishes are a hardy cool-season vegetable that can produce many crops each season due to its rapid days to maturity. Radishes can be planted in both the spring and the fall but growing should be suspended in the warmer months. They are a very easy vegetable to grow.,1,1,60,2,2,Radishes will be ready to harvest quite rapidly as three weeks after planting for some varieties. Pull at the base of the stem when harvesting.
28,Rhubarb,Rhubarb is a perennial vegetable though it is generally used as a fruit in desserts and jams. You only eat the stalks which have a rich tart flavor. The leaves of this plant are poisonous so be sure that they are not ingested. Rhubarb is easy to grow but needs cool weather to thrive.,3,4,70,48,48,Do not harvest any stalks during the first growing season so that your plants can become established. Harvest the stalks when they are 12 to 18 inches long. Usually after 3 years the harvest period runs 8 to 10 weeks long. If the stalks become thin stop harvesting; this means the plant's food reserves are low. Grab the base of the stalk and pull it away from the plant with a gentle twist. If this doesn't work you can cut the stalk at the base. Be sure the discard of the leaves! Always leave at least 2 stalks per plant to ensure continued production. You may have a bountiful harvest for up to 20 years without having to replace your rhubarb plants.
29,Spinach,This super-cold-hardy vegetable is a tender crop that can be planted in very early spring as well as fall and winter. Spinach has similar growing conditions and requirements as lettuce but it is more versatile in both its nutrition and its ability to be eaten raw or cooked. It is higher in iron calcium and vitamins than most cultivated greens and one of the best sources of vitamins A B and C.,2,1,45,3-4,3-4,Keep an eye on your plants. Harvest when leaves reach desired size. Harvest by pinching outer leaves at their base. Donâ€™t wait too long to harvest or wait for larger leaves; bitterness will set in quickly after maturity.
30,Summer Squash,Squash is a seasonal vegetable. It is very susceptible to frost and heat damage but with proper care it will produce a bumper crop with very few plants. There are many varieties of summer squash to choose from including zucchini. The main difference between winter and summer varieties is their harvest time; the longer growing period gives winter squash a tougher inedible skin,1,1,90,48-72,48-72,Harvest summer squash when small and tender for best flavor. Most varieties average 60 days to maturity and are ready as soon as a week after flowering. Check plants everyday for new produce. Cut the squash off the vine rather than breaking them off.
32,Turnips,Turnips are biennials usually grown as annuals. Although turnips are more of a staple in European kitchens many southern gardeners like to grow them for their greens. Turnips take up to two months to mature. Turnips grow best in a temperate climate but can endure light frost. Fall crops are usually sweeter and more tender than spring cropsâ€”and pests are less of a problem.,3,1,30,6,6,Harvest some turnips very early as greens. Harvest early types after about 5 weeks; maincrop types after 6 to 10 weeks. Harvest turnips at any size you wish. The small young turnips are nice and tender. Pull mature turnips before they become woody and before the first frost.
33,Watermelon,Everyone seems to love juicy watermelon in the summertime. Native to Africa melons need warm temperatures (up to 80 degrees during the day) and a long growing season. Gardeners in colder climates can still have success in growing watermelon by starting seeds indoors and choosing short-season varieties. Days to maturity range from 70 to 90 depending on the variety.,2,1,120,72,72,Watermelons donâ€™t sweeten after they are picked so harvest time is important. They generally ripen over two weeks so keep you eye on them. Check the tendril. If it's green wait. If itâ€™s half-dead the watermelon is nearly ripe or ripe. If the tendril is fully dead it's ripe or overripe; itâ€™s not going to get any riper so you might as well pick! Stems should be cut with a sharp knife close to the fruit.
34,Winter Squash,Squash is a seasonal vegetable. It is very susceptible to frost and heat damage but with proper care it will produce a bumper crop with very few plants. There are many varieties of summer squash to choose from including zucchini. The main difference between winter and summer varieties is their harvest time; the longer growing period gives winter squash a tougher inedible skin,4,1,45,48-72,48-72,Harvest winter squash when rind is hard and deep in color usually late September through October.
35,Thyme,Thyme is a small perennial shrub with lots of branches and light purple to pink flowers. It's aromatic and has a pleasant pungent clover flavor. There are over fifty varieties used in cooking and gardening. English thyme is used most often in cooking.,3,1,60,6,6,Throughout the summer leaves and sprigs can be harvested at any time.
36,Oregano,Oregano is a perennial with rose-purple or white flowers and a taste reminiscent of thyme. Its taste is zesty and strong and is commonly used in Italian dishes. Oregano is a hardy plant and makes a good ground cover.,1,1,70,8-12,8-12,Harvest the leaves as you need them. The most flavor-filled leaves are found right before the flowers bloom. Harvest using scissors and give the herb a â€œhaircutâ€.
37,Rosemary,Rosemary is a perennial evergreen shrub with blue flowers. It is a pungent and distinctive plant with a sweet resinous flavor. Rosemary is ideal for a rock garden or the top of a dry wall. It is used for poultry lamb stews and soups.,2,3,45,48,48,Prune the stems to use fresh. During the winter bring a rosemary plant indoors. Harvest using scissors and give the herb a â€œhaircutâ€.
41,Sage,Sage is a hardy perennial with soft grayish green leaves. Its flower colors vary; they can be purple pink blue or white. Common sage is used most commonly for cooking; it's a classic in stuffing.,4,1,90,24-30,24-30,During the first year harvest lightly to ensure that the plant grows fully. After the first year. be sure to leave a few stalks so that the plant can rejuvenate. If fully established one plant can be harvested up to three times in one season.
43,Okra,Okra is traditionally a southern U.S. plant that thrives in warm weather. It is easy to grow and use and looks great throughout the growing season due to its beautiful flowers. Okra is also rich in vitamin A and low in calories.,1,1,30,10-18,10-18,The first harvest will be ready about 2 months after planting. Harvest the okra when its about 2 to 3 inches long. Harvest it every other day. Cut the stem just above the cap with a knife; if the stem is too hard to cut the pod is probably too old and should be tossed. Wear gloves and long sleeves when cutting the okra because most varieties are covered with tiny spines that will irritate your skin unless you have a spineless variety. Do not worry: this irritation will not happen when you eat them.
44,Sweet Potato,The sweet potato is a warm-season spreading vegetable of tropical origin. It is a good choice for a garden because it is easy to grow is drought- / heat-tolerant and has few pests or diseases. The sweet potato is also very nutritious and low in calories.,3,1,120,12-18,12-18,You can start digging up the potatoes as soon as they are big enough for a meal. Often this is three to four months from when you planted the slips. The leaves should have started to yellow but you can leave them in the ground up until the fall frost. Since the roots spread 4 to 6 inches deep in the soil a spade fork is useful when digging up the potatoes.
45,Dill,Dill is an annual self-seeding plant with feathery green leaves. It is used most commonly in soups stews and for pickling. Dill is easy to grow and attracts beneficial insects to your garden such as wasps and other predatory insects.,2,1,45,12-18,12-18,As soon as the plant has four to five leaves you can start harvesting. Pinch off the leaves or cut them off with scissors. If you have a lot of plants you can pinch off entire stalks.
3,Lettuce,This is a half-hardy vegetable that you can keep growing all season long by planting one small crop at a time. Days to maturity tend to be short. Garden lettuce is far superior in both taste and vitamin A content to supermarket brands.,1,1,60,8-16,8-16,Lettuce should be harvested when full size but just before maturity. You want it young and tender. Before maturity you can harvest leaf lettuce by simply removing outer leaves so that the center leaves can continue to grow. Butterhead or romaine types can be harvested by removing the outer leaves digging up the whole plant or cutting the plant about an inch above the soil surface. A second harvest is often possible this way. Crisphead lettuce is picked when the center is firm. Itâ€™s best to harvest in the morning before leaves have been exposed to sun.
2,Basil,Basil is a leafy fragrant annual with a bushy appearance. The most common type of basil is sweet basil; other types include purple basil (less sweet than common basil) Lemon basil (lemon flavor) and Thai basil (licorice flavor). Basil is easy to grow and works well in Italian dishes but it only grows in the summer so plan accordingly.,2,2,70,12-24,12-24,After the seedlings have their first six leaves prune to above the second set. Pinch or cut at the base lateral stems to harvest. The best time to harvest is right when the plant starts to bud (before the flowers bloom).
40,Mint,Mint is a perennial with very fragrant toothed leaves and tiny purple pink or white flowers. It has a fruity aromatic taste. There are many varieties of mintâ€”all fragrant whether shiny or fuzzy smooth or crinkled bright green or variegated. However you can always tell a member of the mint family by its square stem. Rolling it between your fingers youâ€™ll notice a pungent scent and think of candy sweet teas or maybe even mint juleps.,4,1,45,n/a,n/a,Right before flowering cut the stems 1 inch from the ground. You can harvest one mint plant two or three times in one growing season. You can also just pick the leaves as you need them.
42,Tarragon,Tarragon is a perennial herb with long light green leaves and tiny greenish or yellowish white flowers. For cooking use French tarragon. Russian tarragon can easily be mistaken for French but Russian tarragon is coarser and less flavorful than French tarragon.,1,1,90,24-36,24-36,Harvest your plant regularly. Two or three plants will suffice if you regularly prune them. Tarragon is best used fresh in the summer.
7,Beets,Beets are a cool season vegetable crop. This root veggie grows quickly and has many different varieties which showcase deep red yellow or white bulbs of different shapes. They can survive frost and almost freezing temperatures which makes them a good choice for northern gardeners and an excellent long-season crop.,3,1,30,3-4,3-4,Days to maturity tend to be between 50 and 70 for most varieties although they can be harvested at any time you see fit. If you like larger bulbs wait longer but understand they will be tougher and woody. Donâ€™t let greens grow above 6 inches before harvesting. Donâ€™t forget about the tops! Beet greens have a delicious and distinctive flavor and hold more nutrition than the roots.
12,Celery,Celery is a long-season crop that can be tricky to grow some might say the trickiest of all. It likes fertile soil cool temperatures and constant moisture. It will not tolerate heat and can be hard to transplant. Summer crops in the north and winter crops in the south make celery a year-round producer. All the work is worth it when you harvest crunchy green stalks.,2,1,120,10-12,10-12,The parts of celery that are harvested are mainly the stalks which will be above ground. Harvest stalks from the outside in. You may begin harvesting when stalks are about 8 inches tall.
22,Parsnips,Parsnips popular with ancient Greeks and Romans were brought over to the Americas with the first colonists. Although parsnips are biennials they are usually grown as an annual vegetable. Parsnips are a hardy cool-season crop that is best harvested after a hard frost. Parsnips are not only tasty in soups and stews but can also be enjoyed by themselves.,1,2,45,4-6,4-6,Parsnips mature in about 16 weeks. Leave your parsnips in the ground for a few frosts but harvest before the ground freezes. If you leave them in the ground for the winter cover them with a thick layer of mulch and harvest immediately after the ground thaws in the spring.
23,Peas,Peas are a cool-season crop now coming in three separate varieties to suit your garden and cooking needs. They are: Pisum savitum which includes both garden peas (sweet pea inedible pod) and snow peas (edible flat pod with small peas inside) and Pisum macrocarpon snap peas (edible pod with full-size peas). They are easy to grow but with a very limited growing season. Furthermore they do not stay fresh long after harvest so enjoy them while you can!,2,2,60,3,3,Keep your peas well picked to encourage more pods to develop. Pick peas in the morning after the dew has dried. They are crispiest then. Always use two hands when you pick peas. Secure the vine with one hand and pull the peas off with your other hand.
31,Chard,Chard is a member of the beet family that does well in both cool and warm temperatures. It can be cooked or used raw in salads and is high in vitamins A and C.,4,2,70,6,6,You can start harvesting when the plants are 6 to 8 inches tall. Cut off the outer leaves 1-Â½ inches above the ground with a sharp knife. If you harvest the leaves carefully new leaves will grow and provide another harvest.
38,Cilantro,Coriander/cilantro is a fast-growing aromatic herb that grows in the cooler weather of spring and fall. This herb is used to flavor many recipes and the entire plant is edible. The leaves are called cilantro and the seeds are called coriander.,1,2,45,12,12,Harvest while it is low. When the cilantro grows its stalk cut off the plant after the seeds drop and let it self-seed. The large leaves can be cut individually from the plants. For the smaller leaves cut them off 1-Â½ to 2 inches above the crown. You can also remove the entire plant at once; however this means that you will not be able to continue harvesting for the rest of the growing season.
39,Parsley,Parsley is a biennial plant with bright green featherlike leaves and is in the same family as dill. This herb is used in soups sauces and salads and it lessens the need for salt in soups. Not only is it the perfect garnish but also it is healthy; itâ€™s rich in iron and vitamins A and C.,3,2,90,6-10,6-10,When the leaf stems have three segments parsley is ready to be harvested. Cut leaves from the outer portions of the plant whenever you need them. Leave the inner portions of the plant to mature.
5,Asparagus,Asparagus is a perennial bulb and stem vegetable that greets us every spring. It may take 2 to 3 years to get started and produce so patience is needed! But then the plant can be productive up to 20 years so we think it's worth the wait. Asparagus has male and female plants with the female plants producing berries. Regions with cool winters are best for this cool-season crop.,2,2,30,15-18,15-18,Asparagus can take three growing seasons to harvest; you may be able to lightly harvest during the second year. In the first year just let the asparagus go vegetative to give the crown a chance to get well established. Next spring remove the old fern growth from the previous year and keep an eye open for the new spears to begin emerging. For the following years maintain the bed and harvest only the spears thicker than a pencil. Harvest for 2 or 3 weeks. After you harvest leave the ferns so it can gather nourishment for next year's growth.
